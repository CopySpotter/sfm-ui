## Citing SFM
The recommended citation for Social Feed Manager (i.e., the software) is:

    George Washington University Libraries. (2016). Social Feed Manager. Zenodo. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.597278
    
See our [guidance](http://sfm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/citing.html) on citing SFM and datasets.    

## TweetSets

Selected datasets collected by GWU are available via [TweetSets](https://tweetsets.library.gwu.edu) for research and archiving purposes.

TweetSets allows users to choose an existing dataset; limit the dataset by querying on keywords, hashtags, and other parameters; and generate 
and download dataset derivatives such as the list of tweet ids and mention nodes/edges. TweetSets is for academic purposes only and conforms
to Twitter's policies. 

## Published datasets

Datasets of tweet identifiers from GWU-collected datasets are available at [GW Libraries Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/gwu-libraries).
