Social Feed Manager just turned 2! That’s 2 years old (new SFM was first released in the summer of 2016) and [version 2](https://github.com/gwu-libraries/sfm-docker/releases). Version 2 is all about upgrades, including python 3, django 2, and [warcprox 2](https://github.com/internetarchive/warcprox). Most other dependencies have been updated to the latest as well and some ugly code for reading WARC files has been replaced with WebRecorder’s elegant [warcio](https://github.com/webrecorder/warcio).

Make sure and consult the [release notes](https://github.com/gwu-libraries/sfm-docker/releases/tag/2.0.0) for upgrading, as there are some additional steps for this release. If everything went well, you should notice no differences. However, the nature of the changes make subtle bugs possible, so let us know if you encounter any problems.

Here’s hoping this positions SFM to continue supporting social media collecting well into the future!
