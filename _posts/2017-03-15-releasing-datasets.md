excerpt: "Instructions are now available for exporting a dataset from SFM and publishing to Dataverse."

The SFM team at GW Libraries, like a number of other institutions and individuals, publishes datasets containing tweet ids for some of our collections.<sup>1</sup> (Many of these public datasets are listed in the [DocNow Catalog](http://www.docnow.io/catalog/).)  We publish our datasets to [GW Libraries’ dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/gwu-libraries) on [Harvard’s Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu) instance.

Soomin Park, a data science student and member of the SFM team, authored [instructions for exporting a dataset from SFM and publishing to Dataverse](http://sfm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/releasing_datasets.html).  The instructions are based on her experiences releasing the 7 million tweet [Women’s March dataset](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/5ZVMOR).  Feedback is welcome.

<sup>1</sup> As background:  Twitter’s [Developer Policy](https://dev.twitter.com/overview/terms/agreement-and-policy#id8) only permits public datasets to include tweet ids. Publishing the full JSON for tweets is prohibited. As has been [pointed out](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=2908131.2908172), this is problematic for quality, reproducible research.
