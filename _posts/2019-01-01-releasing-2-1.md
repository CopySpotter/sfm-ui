We’re pleased that one of the first things we get to do in 2019 is release SFM version 2.1.0. 
We’ve made security upgrades, fixed some bugs related to collection exports and the change log, 
updated versions of some dependencies, and improved collection privacy in the Monitor page. 

Thanks to contributions from Justin Littman 
of Stanford University Libraries, SFM now allows for closer integration with AWS services 
(in particular, an Elastic Load Balancer and Simple Email Service).

Consult the [release notes](https://github.com/gwu-libraries/sfm-docker/releases/tag/2.1.0) for information 
on the new optional environment variable for setting up AWS Simple Email Service
and the [SFM documentation](https://sfm.readthedocs.io/en/2.1.0/install.html#upgrading) for upgrading instructions.
