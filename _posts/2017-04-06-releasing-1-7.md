I'm catching a plane later today, so this is going to be a quick post to describe some of the highlights of [version 1.7](https://github.com/gwu-libraries/sfm-docker/releases/tag/1.7.0) of Social Feed Manager.

As in the post about our previous release, I'm going to rely on pictures.

One of Social Feed Manager's goals is to support researcher and archivist needs for data documentation by recording and making available provenance metadata for the social media data. ([More on this.](https://gwu-libraries.github.io/sfm-ui/resources/provenance-of-tweet.pdf)) Much of this metadata is automatically collected and put into the change log. However, in working with faculty and in building our own collections, we've come to realize that we need to support adding notes at any point in the lifespan of collection, including when it's turned off. We're interested to see what uses archivists and researchers find for this feature. 

Also in this release, we added support for changes Twitter has made to the structure of a tweet. Missed or confused by those changes? This [blog post](https://gwu-libraries.github.io/sfm-ui/posts/2017-03-31-extended-tweets) digs into the changes.

We recently discovered a [significant flaw](https://github.com/gwu-libraries/sfm-ui/issues/616) in our web harvesting, which was fixed in this release. Thanks to Victor Tan for tracking it down. If you have questions about your web harvests, please [contact us](https://gwu-libraries.github.io/sfm-ui/contact).

Phew, now I can enjoy my vacation while the rest of the team kicks off version 1.8.
